        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p style="padding-left:100px; padding-right:100px; padding-top:50px; padding-bottom:50px;"><span class="auto-style6">Back in 2018, we decided to take our Exotic car love to the next level. We opened our first location in downtown Atlanta, Georgia. We started out with only 3 vehicles, a Ferrari F430, Mercedez Benz SLS AMG and the old faithful Mercedes Benz G500 &quot;G-Wagon&quot;. We&#39;ve since expanded our fleet to over 20 vehicles, in a wide range of classes. We currently have 2 more sister stores slated to begin operations in 2020. Our goal for this company is to bring the joy of driving Exotic cars to the every day person, and we hope you will help take us there!</span> </p>
